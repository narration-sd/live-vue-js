## About Live Vue JS

Live Vue JS is the JavaScript package supporting Live Vue, which extends Craft CMS to provide its expected rapid and precise Live Previews, when it's the data source for a JS framework website.

Live Vue JS implements the client side of Live Vue, for your delivery application.

## Platforms

Live Vue is first available for Gatsby JS, and should arrive before long for Gridsome, Vue, and React SPA frameworks.

## Documentation

Live Vue JS details are on the documentation website for all of Live Vue:  

https://narrationsd.com/docs/live-vue. 

## Implementation Guidance

You'll find that Live Vue JS integrates easily with site pages you already have, since its plug-in components give a simple way of adding the abilities.

Getting up and running overall should also be smooth, helped where useful by the advice of Hal, the embedded guidance counselor.

## Status

Live Vue JS is available to your project via npm in the usual way:
```
npm install -D @narration-sd/live-vue-js
```
