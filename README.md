## About Live Vue JS

Live Vue JS is the JavaScript side of Live Vue, which extends Craft CMS to provide its expected Live Previews, when it's the data source for a precompiled or otherwise JS framework website.

Live Vue JS implements the client side of Live Vue, for your delivery application.

## Platforms

Live Vue is first available for Gatsby JS, and should arrive before long for Gridsome, Vue, and React SPA frameworks, likely in that order.

## Documentation

You'll find Live Vue JS details on the documentation website for all of Live Vue:  

https://narrationsd.com/docs/live-vue. 

## Implementation Guidance

You'll find that Live Vue JS integrates easily with site pages you already have, since its plug-in components give a simple way of adding the abilities.

Getting up and running overall should also be smooth, helped where useful by the advice of Hal, an embedded guidance counselor.

## Status

Live Vue JS will shortly be in public Beta, available to your build via npm, with full release soon after.
