A companion to Live Vue, which implements the browser side for new and legacy ES6 applications.

For the initial Beta, only the Live Vue Gatsby portion is included, as React code. The Vue implementation, while substantial and historically first, will follow later.

Please see the documentation for details, at https://narrationsd.com/docs/live-vue
